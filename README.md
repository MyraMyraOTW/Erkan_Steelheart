## Roleplaying

#### Details

Erkan is an orange kobold with striking green eyes. He has a small stature at 2' 7" which lends to his stealthiness. He dresses in simple clothes that bear stains from the chemicals he works with.

**Background:** Airship Crew  
**Alignment:** Neutral  
**Eye Colour:** Green  
**Scale Colour:** Orange  
**Age:** 31  
**Height:** 2' 7"  
**Weight:** 30 lbs  

#### Personality Traits

I am brash and forward thinking, always seeking to prove myself. I stick to my decisions and rarely take no for an answer. This is due to my race and the discrimination I faced during my early life in the Uungerthold guard.

#### Bonds

I respect those who fight beside me and would gladly lay down my life for them.

#### Ideals

I believe all individuals, no matter the race deserve respect.

#### Flaws

I don't fight fair and would rather kill someone when they're at an extreme disadvantage.

#### Backstory

Erkan's story began as a stowaway egg on an airship, stolen away from his nest by some wayward adventurers. The trip was uneventful safe for the adventurers being tossed overboard for not working. The captain, a gnomish woman decided to keep the egg.

Erkan was adopted by the gnomish woman and a dwarven man, Rema and Bodger Steelheart. His early life was filled with helping his mother and father around their airship the twilight falcon (an old mercenary ship) and doing chores for the crew. He learned the ship inside and out and gained many skills.

Eventually he left his parents to make his own way in the Uungerthold  guard. He experienced his fair share of discrimination but ended up proving himself and gaining some friends. This lead him to working as a specialist under the Colonel's command.

#### Allies + Organizations

The Colonel's Honor Guard:  
Served as a Sapper for the Colonel. Worked operations involving the safe destruction of dangerous materials and illegal properties. Was also involved in the disarming of traps placed in dwarven mining tunnels by the creatures that live there.

## Adventure Notes

#### Day 1
My adventure begins with orders from the Colonel and directions given by one of the spymasters (see Priceless Items).

#### Day 2
I have been introduced to the party by the Colonel and while receiving a hostile welcome from Jun, Heskan eventually gave me the benefit of the doubt. The Colonel gave the party a very lucrative mission rewarding lands worth ~2200 GP and 250 GP each. The Colonel requested I travel with the party to solve an issue at the damaged church. Two of my battle brothers have been charmed by the fishy smelling elf and I will do my best to get them home safe.

We travelled to see an elf named Adallon on the other side of the city and talked about some information I did not have context for.

While travelling to the Bedrock Inn, Golan and myself took  a shortcut and I got drunk. I ended up passing out on the stairs.

#### Day 3
I've spent the morning talking with Thoridin and learned of what the party has been up to while he's been around.

At around 5 PM we headed out to the broken church.

###### The Broken Church

**Part 1**  
We've made it to the broken church and managed to clear the top floor with not much issue. 1 casualty and 8 unconscious dwarven commoners. It appears we've been noticed by the foul creature within sadly. We've tied up 7 of the unconscious dwarves and are poised to enter the building.

**Part 2**

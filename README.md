## Roleplaying

#### Details

Erkan is an orange kobold with striking green eyes. He has a small stature at 2' 7" which lends to his stealthiness. He dresses in simple clothes that bear stains from the chemicals he works with.

**Background:** Airship Crew  
**Alignment:** Neutral  
**Eye Colour:** Green  
**Scale Colour:** Orange  
**Age:** 31  
**Height:** 2' 7"  
**Weight:** 30 lbs  

#### Personality Traits

I am brash and forward thinking, always seeking to prove myself. I stick to my decisions and rarely take no for an answer. This is due to my race and the discrimination I faced during my early life in the Uungerthold guard.

#### Bonds

I respect those who fight beside me and would gladly lay down my life for them.

#### Ideals

I believe all individuals, no matter the race deserve respect.

#### Flaws

I don't fight fair and would rather kill someone when they're at an extreme disadvantage.

#### Backstory

Erkan's story began as a stowaway egg on an airship, stolen away from his nest by some wayward adventurers. The trip was uneventful safe for the adventurers being tossed overboard for not working. The captain, a gnomish woman decided to keep the egg.

Erkan was adopted by the gnomish woman and a dwarven man, Rema and Bodger Steelheart. His early life was filled with helping his mother and father around their airship the twilight falcon (an old mercenary ship) and doing chores for the crew. He learned the ship inside and out and gained many skills.

Eventually he left his parents to make his own way in the Uungerthold  guard. He experienced his fair share of discrimination but ended up proving himself and gaining some friends. This lead him to working as a specialist under the Colonel's command.

#### Allies + Organizations

The Colonel's Honor Guard [Old]:  
Served as a Sapper for the Colonel. Worked operations involving the safe destruction of dangerous materials and illegal properties. Was also involved in the disarming of traps placed in dwarven mining tunnels by the creatures that live there.

## Adventure Notes

#### Day 1
My adventure begins with orders from the Colonel and directions given by one of the spymasters (see Priceless Items).

#### Day 2
I have been introduced to the party by the Colonel and while receiving a hostile welcome from Jun, Heskan eventually gave me the benefit of the doubt. The Colonel gave the party a very lucrative mission rewarding lands worth ~2200 GP and 250 GP each. The Colonel requested I travel with the party to solve an issue at the damaged church. Two of my battle brothers have been charmed by the fishy smelling elf and I will do my best to get them home safe.

We travelled to see an elf named Adallon on the other side of the city and talked about some information I did not have context for.

While travelling to the Bedrock Inn, Golan and myself took  a shortcut and I got drunk. I ended up passing out on the stairs.

#### Day 3
I've spent the morning talking with Thoridin and learned of what the party has been up to while he's been around.

At around 5 PM we headed out to the broken church.

###### The Broken Church

**Part 1**  
We've made it to the broken church and managed to clear the top floor with not much issue. 1 casualty and 8 unconscious dwarven commoners. It appears we've been noticed by the foul creature within sadly. We've tied up 7 of the unconscious dwarves and are poised to enter the building.

**Part 2**  
After entering the depths of the broken church we were attacked by some foul shadow beasts that stole the strength of my comrades. While difficult to fight the holy fire of our cleric Heskan purified them from this world. Moving deeper into the underground I was ambushed by my once battle brothers; Jun, Golan and myself were able to knock them unconscious. While Investigating a side door and tying up my battle brother a commotion occurred down the hall and Golan was knocked to the ground. After not seeing anyone come to Golan's aid I attempted to stabilize him, however my skills not being suited to this he bled out.

**Part 3**  
In KingStone keep's court I have recognized spymaster Torvir. I have received some recognition and gained the Purple Dragon Crest from the King. We are waiting for a job from the King and have done some downtime. I have decided to fight some crime while on my downtime and I've purchased a pony named Terry.

###### The Keep
**The 183rd Standard Day**  
We've failed our quest for the king but we've taken a job from the Colonel to deal with Octodad.

###### The Sewers
We've gone into the sewers and dealt with Octodad disguising the body as an "Alligator" and have returned to the Colonel.

###### Downtime
I have done the job required by the spymaster at the airship dock for securing the negotiation rights with Torvir.

###### The Wastelands
Our flight to the wastelands was interrupted by Sky Pirates which and a small blue dragon. We've lost the ship and Adallon in the battle. The survivors other than the party were the captain.
